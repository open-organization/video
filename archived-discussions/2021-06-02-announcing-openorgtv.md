Today with the sixth anniversary of The Open Organization community, we officially announce our new multimedia outlet. This will provide the Ambassadors, *and various community members*, a way to contribute through discussions, quick topic highlights, and roundtables.

You'll see we have begun several series which you can sort by playlist! 

Don't forget to share, like, and subscribe to the channel! And, set your notifications for your weekly video reminders!

Visit us now at [The Open Organization TV](https://theopenorganization.tv) !
