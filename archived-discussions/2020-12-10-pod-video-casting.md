# Pod and/or Video Castin’

For some time now, members of the Open Organization project have shared a desire to spread our message in a medium other than print. While our work on [articles](https://opensource.com/open-organization) and [books](https://theopenorganization.org/books) continues unabated, we agree that we can engage audiences, learners, and potential community contributors in new and exciting ways.

At [December's community call](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/december-10-2020-meeting/175/1), Open Organization Ambassadors agreed to make planning for new media ventures a priority for the [upcoming 2021 strategy session](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/a-2021-strategy-workshop/176) in January. Moreover, @jenkelchner asked if folks interested in working on this project could in fact meet sooner than January, so that we have some data and/or directions to bring *to* the planning session (so we're not "starting from scratch" there). Others agreed this was a Good Idea :tm:.

So I'm writing to ask if anyone interested in seeing the Open Organization project in a podcast/videocast form would like to hold an informal discussion, brainstorming, and ideation session before the end of December 2020.

At this session, we'd discuss things like:

- What are our goals for producing community audio- and videocasts? And who is our audience for them?
- What tools and platforms could we use to produce and share such things?
- How would we make the work most collaborative and inclusive?
- What resources will we need to get started?

... and anything else that piques our interest.

Interested? See below.

The above-mentioned brainstorm team met today to discuss this project. Below, please find notes from our session.

The group intends to begin work soon, so invites more discussion here and at our upcoming strategy session.

# Why new media?

Jen: A move to a new medium is important. The potential audience on video is huge. Audio and video are key media for reaching a target audience of organizational leaders, provided we create artifacts in "small bites" (keep the content short, sweet, limited, direct. For reference: "Long" content is 25‒30 minutes. This is material people are "working into their days" (while they're on a walk, on the train, in the car, etc.).

Ron: Consider that our target is not really the classic "executive," but, more broadly, someone in an organization who feels compelled and empowered to make a change. Experience shows that audiences will engage with video (where we have hundreds of readers, we could have thousands of viewers).

Jos: Executives, middle managers—it doesn't matter, as long as we're targeting someone who's seeking to do things another way.

# What's the goal?

Heidi's goals: Give “voice” to our work, personalizing our involvement in open org. To expand the reach of our work (since users consume audio and video a lot - multitasking). Written content requires long stretches of time to concentrate and create so a change to podcasts or videos capitalizes on the ad-hoc/responsive nature of the COVID world we are currently in.

Bryan's goals: Create new contributor pathways so more people with different talents can join the Open Organization project and community. Architect a process that is collaborative (between ambassadors) and inclusive of anyone who wants to participate. Reduce bottlenecks by keeping production simple and distributed, but do keep a small and flexible process in place (along with editorial guidelines) to ensure consistency.

# What's the platform?

YouTube has an immense audience and is a platform our target audience already uses. It also allows us to bootstrap a channel quickly, and allows us to contribute both audio and video content. Additionally, some ambassadors have prior experience using YouTube and can assist here.

The goal, then, would be to launch an Open Organization channel with multiple playlists, each playlist corresponding to a different series, topic, or personality.

# What's the process?

Not every contributor can work with video. Having access to the video platform is a benefit of being an Open Organization Ambassador. Ambassadors can have a vid/podcast "channel" or "playlist" in our unified channel if they'd like.

We'd consider co-constructing a flexible editorial process for video, much like the process we currently have in place for print materials. This could include a collaborative editorial calendar on GitHub, like [the one we maintain for our print work](https://github.com/open-organization/editorial/projects/1). This way, everyone can see what's in progress, what's scheduled, when others are posting video, etc., so we can coordinate and collaborate.

We'd also want to write and maintain a set of video editorial guidelines (see below).

# What do we need?

* We need graphics/collateral for videos
  * Jen could create some basic intro/outro bumpers for us
  * We could use some animated bumpers if possible, and Bryan can request from Open Source Program Office (but will need to wait until at least February)
* We need to co-construct some editorial guidelines for video and establish a collaborative process for maintaining a calendar/schedule
* A channel introduction video (~ 2 mins in length)

# Where do we go from here?

* Set up YouTube channel under an OpenOrg account (would need to be a Google account)
* Add “admins” (or whatever YouTube term is) for Ambassadors contributing
* Establish editorial process and guidelines for video and audio production
* Determine initial production—perhaps target 1‒3 videos that we'll create to launch the channel, record them, produce them, schedule them
