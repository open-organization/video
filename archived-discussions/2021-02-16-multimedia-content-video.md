# Multimedia Content - Video

Hello, Ambassadors!  

It is official. We are launching multimedia to deliver our thought work.  In the next week, I'll be adding some rough guidelines for production that will help us all make this a super easy process for creating, editing, reviewing, and publishing our work. As you know, we are starting with video published to Youtube before we branch out to other mediums.

So first things first....

I'd like a quick chat with any Ambassador who is wanting to begin publishing via the OpenOrg YouTube channel.

If you are interested in doing any video publications, you can book a quick chat with me here [https://jenkelchner.as.me/openorg].

During the chat we will talk about a few things like...

* Your direction and style of content
* Your "playlist" -- think of this as your "show" (optional, it can just be your name)


Hope to talk to you all soon!  Hit me for questions!


Additionally:  We are going to begin pooling ideas for our Welcome Trailer which will serve to push to our booth at Summit this year.  More on this soon but feel free to reach out .

Thanks for this! I'm in.

FYI: Your appointment link was broken for me so I edited the formatting to help it work a little better for others.

Big thanks to @jenkelchner for meeting with me today to answer all my questions about video and our new channel. I'd encourage anyone who's interested in—even just considering—getting involved in our new YouTube channel to set up some time with @jenkelchner using the link she provided. Today I learned about basic YouTube strategy, reviewed some features of the platform, and chatted about content ideas.I learned a lot!

Even if you think you might not be jumping into video for a little while, this is still a great time to touch base with our video maintainer and learn a bit more about what's possible (I know @HeidiHVL and @samknuth are already strategizing).
